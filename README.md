# Simple text based RPG
This is a simple text based rpg that i decided to develop to learn C++ and to achieve a better understanding and comfortability with the language.

This has some simple procedural features such as different types of enemies and procedural stats.

The game also has a stat based system which will impact how certain abilities work and how much damage they deal
